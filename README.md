ExampleContract

This is a simple Solidity smart contract that manages a value with three main functions: setting the value, dividing it by two, and withdrawing funds.


Value Management: The contract allows you to set an initial value, divide it by two (if even), and withdraw a specified amount.
Events: The contract emits events for key actions to provide logs for blockchain transactions.

Functions

setValue(uint _value):

Sets the value to _value.
Requires _value to be greater than 0.
Emits the ValueSet event.

divideByTwo():

Divides the value by two.
Requires the value to be even.
Emits the ValueDivided event.

withdrawFunds(uint amount):

Withdraws the specified amount from value.
Requires that the amount does not exceed the current value.
Emits the FundsWithdrawn event with the amount withdrawn and the remaining balance.

Events

ValueSet(uint newValue): Triggered when the value is set.

ValueDivided(uint newValue): Triggered when the value is divided by two.

FundsWithdrawn(uint amount, uint remainingBalance): Triggered when funds are withdrawn.

Usage

Deploy the Contract: Deploy the contract on a compatible Ethereum network.

Set a Value: Call setValue with a positive integer to initialize the value.

Divide the Value: Call divideByTwo if the current value is even.

Withdraw Funds: Call withdrawFunds with the amount you wish to withdraw, ensuring it doesn't exceed the current value.
